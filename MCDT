<h1>Molloy College Dance Team</h1>
 <body>
  <p>Molloy College Dance Team is the one and only dance team at the college. The team has been around for years and has 
  continued to improve more and more as time passed. The team used to only perform at men's and women's basketball games.
  Just 2 years ago the team started competing in regional competitions against other colleges. This year, finally, the 
  team is making it's way to nationals in florida for the Universal Dance Association competition against colleges around
  the world! The team mostly performs routines in pom or jazz, and some of their routines during timeouts at basketball 
  games are hiphop. This year the team has improved drastically by improving not only their dancing, but their acrobatic
  skills as well!</p>
